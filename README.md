## General Information
- The problem that we are trying to solve is to predict housing prices in the United States using machine learning. We have a dataset of housing prices in the US from the past few years, and we want to use this data to train a machine learning model that can predict future housing prices. This is a difficult problem, because there are many factors that affect housing prices, such as the economy, population growth, and interest rates. However, we believe that machine learning can help us to find patterns in the data and make better predictions.
- We are trying to solve the problem of us housing company that they face to predict the prices of houses on australia.
- Dataset we used to make prediction  is given by the US housing company. They collect the data from the Australian market.

## Conclusions
- The data shows that there is a strong correlation between certain features and housing prices. For example, the size of the house, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the location, and the age of the house are all strong predictors of price
- We observe that Year of sale is another fctore that impact the prices of the houses.
- The year a house is built can have an impact on its price for a number of reasons. Newer houses are often built with more up-to-date materials and features, which can add to their value. Additionally, houses that are closer to the current year are generally seen as being more valuable than those that are further back. This is because they are often seen as being more updated and therefore, more desirable. Additionally, the age of a house can impact its price in terms of maintenance and repairs. Older houses may require more work to keep them in good condition, which can add to their cost.
